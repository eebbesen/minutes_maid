Woopdi they have given themselves great pay and a great office and free food. I hope you choke on it. Stop patting your self on the back and try listening to small business and actually doing some work instead of having meetings and discussing how good you think you all are. PS. Lets see if you keep this review, or delete it. BECAUSE ITS TRUE!!!!!!",
